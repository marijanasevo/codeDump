# Webcam

Webcam with filters, ability to snap a photo (+ sound effect) and download it to your computer.

One of the requirements for this challenge is to have a server running. I'm using Visual Studio Code extension - Live Server.

- `<video class="webcam-video">` video from webcam.
- Repeated interval takes a snapshot of the video.
- places it into `<canvas class="photo">`. 
- `<div class="strip">` is a place for snapshots.
